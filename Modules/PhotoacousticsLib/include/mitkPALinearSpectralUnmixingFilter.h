    * \brief This filter is subclass of the spectral unmixing filter base. All algorithms in this class are
    * based on the Eigen open source c++ library. It takes a multispectral pixel as input and returns a vector
    * with the unmixing result.
    *
    * Input:
    * - endmemberMatrix Eigen Matrix with number of chromophores colums and number of wavelengths rows so matrix element (i,j) contains
    *   the absorbtion of chromophore j @ wavelength i taken from the database by PropertyElement method.
    * - inputVector Eigen Vector containing values of one pixel of XY-plane image with number of wavelength rows (z-dimension of a sequenece)
    *   so the pixelvalue of the first wavelength is stored in inputVector[0] and so on.
    *
    * Output:
    * - Eigen vector with unmixing result of one multispectral pixel. The ith element of the vector corresponds to the ith entry of the
    *   m_Chromophore vector.
    *
    * Algorithms (see AlgortihmType enum):
    * - HOUSEHOLDERQR computes the solution by QR decomposition
    * - COLPIVHOUSEHOLDERQR computes the solution by QR decomposition
    * - FULLPIVHOUSEHOLDERQR computes the solution by QR decomposition
    * - LDLT computes the solution by Cholesky decomposition
    * - LLT computes the solution by Cholesky decomposition
    * - JACOBISVD computes the solution by singular value decomposition uses least square solver
    *
    * Possible exceptions:
    * - "algorithm not working": doesn't work now (2018/06/19)
    * - "404 VIGRA ALGORITHM NOT FOUND": Algorithm not implemented
