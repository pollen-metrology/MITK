    * \brief The spectral unmixing filter base is designed as superclass for several spectral unmixing filter eg. Eigen- or Vigrabased ones.
    * One can add wavelengths and chromophores and get a unmixed output images out of one MITK input image using algorithms from the subclasses.
    *
    * Input:
    * The unmixing input has to be a 3D MITK image where the XY-plane is a image and the Z-direction represents recordings for different
    * wavelengths. Herein a XY-plane for a specific Z-direction will be called "image". Every image has to be assigned to a certain wavelength.
    * The "AddWavelength" uses "push_back" to write float values into a vector. The first wavelength will correspond to the first image!!!
    * If there a more input images 'I' then added wavelengths 'w' the filter base interprets the next x images as repetition sequence of the same
    * wavelengths. If I % w !=0 the surplus image(s) will be dropped.
    * Addtionaly one has to add chromophores from the property calculator class enum "ChromophoreType" with the "AddChromophore" method. 
    * This method as well uses "push_back" but the chosen (arbitary) order will be the order of the outputs.
    *
    * Output:
    * The output will be one MITK image per chosen chromophore. Where the XY-plane is a image and the Z-direction represents recordings for different
    * sequences. Furthermore it is possible to creat an output image that contains the information about the relative error between unmixing result
    * and the input image.
    *
    * Subclasses:
    * - mitkPASpectralUnmixingFilterVigra
    * - mitkPALinearSpectralUnmixingFilter (uses Eigen algorithms)
    * - mitkPASpectralUnmixingFilterSimplex
    *
    * Possible exceptions:
    * - "PIXELTYPE ERROR! FLOAT 32 REQUIRED": The MITK input image has to consist out of floats.
    * - "ERROR! REMOVE WAVELENGTHS!": One needs at least the same amount of images (z-dimension) then added wavelengths.
    * - "ADD MORE WAVELENGTHS!": One needs at least the same amount of wavelengths then added chromophores.
    * - "WAVELENGTH XXX nm NOT SUPPORTED!": The wavelength is not part of the proptery calculater data base. The data base can be found @ 
    *   [...]\mitk\Modules\PhotoacousticsLib\Resources\spectralLIB.dat
    * - "ADD OUTPUTS HAS TO BE LARGER THEN ZERO!"
    * - "NO WAVELENGHTS/CHROMOPHORES SELECZED!
    * - "INDEX ERROR! NUMBER OF OUTPUTS DOESN'T FIT TO OTHER SETTIGNS!"
