/**
* \brief The spectral unmixing plugin provides a GUI tool to perform spectral unmixing of multispectral MITK images.
* It was designed to unmix beamformed photoacoustic imgaes. The outputs are as well MITK images for every chosen absorber
* (endmember). Furthermore it is possible to calculate the oxygen saturation of the multispectral input if the endmembers
* oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin are selected in the GUI.
*
* For further information look at the documentation of the mitkPASpectralUnmixingFilterBase.h
*
* @exeption if the GenerateOutput method throws a exception the plugin will show a QMessageBox with the exception
* message at the GUI
