This plugin offers basic tracking functionalities. This includes connecting to a tracking system, logging and recording of tracking data, managing tracking tools and playing recorded tracking data.

The plugin includes different views, which are described on different pages in detail.

As part of the tutorial, it is recommended to get familiar with each of the following views as they lead you through the main functionality of the IGT plugin. Please read the following pages to get familiar with them:

<ul>
<li> \subpage org_mitk_views_igttrackingtoolbox : Allows for connecting a tracking system and logging/recording the tracked data.
<li> \subpage org_mitk_views_igtnavigationtoolmanager : This view offers functionality to manage tool storages. Each tool storage holds a preconfigured tool collection. Once saved you can load a tool storage in the Tracking Toolbox and don't need to add every tool seperately.
